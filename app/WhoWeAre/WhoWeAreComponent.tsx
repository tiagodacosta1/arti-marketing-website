                                Arti Speech was born out of a personal mission to make communication easier for individuals with speech
                                challenges. The inspiration came from the founder's experience with his nonverbal sister, diagnosed with
                                autism at three. Her daily struggles with communication sparked the creation of Arti Speech â€” an app
                                designed to bridge the gap for families, caregivers, and educators alike.

                                whom are based in London, all working together to create a functional and beautifully designed app. With
